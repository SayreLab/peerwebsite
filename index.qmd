## Welcome to PEER!
The Professional development for Emerging Education Researchers (PEER) Institute supports scholars as they become education researchers and expand their research expertise. PEER focuses on Discipline-based Education Research, advancing both scholarship and teaching goals that are valued at all types of academic institutions.

At PEER, you will learn fundamental and applied research skills in a supportive and participatory research environment.

You will delve into research project development and best practices, engage with like-minded professionals, and gain invaluable insights into the world of educational research. Our expert facilitators will guide you through hands-on activities and collaborative discussions, helping you shape your project and engage your passion.

PEER helps faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and independent scholars get started in eduation research. For many participants, PEER is their first research project in education. Other participants are stretching into a new theory or methodology, or re-engaging with research after a hiatus. Everyone has expertise to contribute, and everyone has skills to learn and refine.

PEER participants love the collaborative community in PEER field schools. Many continue on after taking the program, doing research together, submitting papers for peer reviewed publication, or supporting each other through accountability groups.



## Boost your education research skills and push your project forward.

PEER centers participants' research projects to grow their skills. If you've got a project in mind, we will help you develop it. From ideation to peer-reviewed publication, PEER helps move your project forward from any point.

In our intensive, experiential field schools, we cover fundamental skills like generative writing and collaborative feedback as well as foundational topics like choosing theoretical frameworks and matching research questions with data streams. Because you're working on your project all along, you apply your growing skills immediately and your project experiences a ton of growth. Our expert facilitators and evidence-based, time-tested curriculum will guide you -- and your project! -- through enormous growth.

Wherever you're at, we'll help you take your research to the next level.
