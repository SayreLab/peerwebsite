# You've registered!

If this is your first time, welcome to PEER!  If you're coming back to refresh & revitalize, welcome back!

## How should I prepare?

* Read about [writing as a generative process](https://handbook.zaposa.com/articles/generative-writing/), and prepare to engage in your own writing during the workshop. During the workshop, you’ll do generative writing around your research interests and questions.
* Make sure your zoom software is up-to-date and test your microphone and camera. During the workshop, you’ll work in a collaborative breakout group with other participants.
* Look for a calendar invite with a zoom link.
