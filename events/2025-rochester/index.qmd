-   Graduate students or postdoctoral researchers who want to learn more about DBER project management and building a successful research program
-   Faculty at teaching-focused universities interested in using research methodology to improve or assess their teaching and/or publish in Scholarship of Teaching & Learning

# What do we do?

### PEER builds core competencies in education research

PEER enhances the professional growth of participants and changes career trajectories. Our comprehensive professional development covers project design, management, mentoring, communication, and understanding community values. This 'full stack' of activities enhances research abilities. We focus on the participants' interests and projects, fostering motivation and improving success chances.

### Community Building and Networking

PEER promotes peer feedback and community foundation, providing a sense of inclusion in the DBER field and fostering research identity. The networking opportunities at PEER kickstart collaborations and expand professional networks. PEER supports participants from all STEM disciplines, and we focus on emerging education researchers, whatever their career level.

### PEER builds academic currency

Our support includes guiding participants in writing, a key element of academic research. PEER engagement leads to numerous publications, grant proposals, and successful tenure & promotion portfolios. These publications span several years, suggesting PEER's lasting impact on participantsâ€™ professional trajectories.
