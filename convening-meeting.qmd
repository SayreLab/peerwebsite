## Join us!
Hundreds of people throughout the world have participated in PEER since its beginning in 2016. We're so excited to hear about what you have been doing since your PEER experience. Join us November 21st from 2-4 PM EST on Zoom for check-ins with past PEER participants, updates from the PEER Directors, and community building with a large network of education researchers. This event is open to former PEER participants and is meant to be a time to reflect, (re)connect, and re-energize. Check back here on September 1st when registration opens for this virtual event.

During this event, there will be opportunity to do a generative presentation (previously called riffs, generative riffs, etc.). You will be able to apply for a generative presentations slot in the registration form.
