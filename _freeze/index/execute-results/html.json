Through peer and near-peer exchange, PEER helps faculty, postdocs and graduate students through field schools, intensive workshops, research projects, mentoring, and community involvement. Many continue on after taking the program, doing research in working groups, submitting papers for peer reviewed publication or designing research projects with others. PEER focuses on Discipline-based Education Research, advancing both scholarship and teaching goals that are valued at all types of academic institutions.\"\nsidebar: false\n\ntitle-block-banner: \"images/rainbow.jpg\"\n\npage-layout: article\ntoc: false\nsuppress: true\n---\n\n\n::: {.quarto-listing .quarto-listing-container-grid}\n::: {.list .grid .quarto-listing-cols-3}\n\n:::{.g-col-1 .card .card-body .text-center}\n\n[![](images/sayrelab.png)](https://handbook.zaposa.com)\n\n#### [Research Handbook](https://handbook.zaposa.com){.quarto-grid-link .card-title}\n\n[Articles about how to do research, especially in academia and especially in STEM education.](https://handbook.zaposa.com){.quarto-grid-link}\n\n:::\n\n:::{.g-col-1 .card .card-body .text-center}\n[![](images/peer.png)](model/index.qmd)\n\n#### [PEER model](model/index.qmd){.quarto-grid-link .card-title}\n\n[PEER is collaborative, communicative, responsive, and playful.](model/index.qmd){.quarto-grid-link}\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.g-col-1 .card .card-body .text-center}\n\n[![](images/pants.png)](schools/index.qmd)\n\n#### [Field Schools](schools/index.qmd){.quarto-grid-link .card-title}\n\n[PEER events: upcoming, current, and past](schools/index.qmd){ .quarto-grid-link}\n\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n# Opportunities to participate in PEER!\n\nWhether you’re just getting started, looking to stretch into new projects or methodologies, or seeking community and support around education research, we’re happy to have you.
