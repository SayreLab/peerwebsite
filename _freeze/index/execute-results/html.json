PEER focuses on Discipline-based Education Research, advancing both scholarship and teaching goals that are valued at all types of academic institutions.\n\nAt PEER, you will learn fundamental and applied research skills in a supportive and participatory research environment.\n\nYou will delve into research project development and best practices, engage with like-minded professionals, and gain invaluable insights into the world of educational research. Our expert facilitators will guide you through hands-on activities and collaborative discussions, helping you shape your project and engage your passion.\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"false\"}\nCheck out the [PEER Model](model/) to learn more.\n:::\n\n## Getting started in education research? PEER is for you.\n\nPEER helps faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and independent scholars get started in eduation research. For many participants, PEER is their first research project in education. Other participants are stretching into a new theory or methodology, or re-engaging with research after a hiatus. Everyone has expertise to contribute, and everyone has skills to learn and refine.\n\nPEER participants love the collaborative community in PEER field schools. Many continue on after taking the program, doing research together, submitting papers for peer reviewed publication, or supporting each other through accountability groups.\n\n## Boost your education research skills and push your project forward.\n\nPEER centers participants' research projects to grow their skills. If you've got a project in mind, we will help you develop it. From ideation to peer-reviewed publication, PEER helps move your project forward from any point.\n\nIn our intensive, experiential field schools, we cover fundamental skills like generative writing and collaborative feedback as well as foundational topics like choosing theoretical frameworks and matching research questions with data streams. Because you're working on your project all along, you apply your growing skills immediately and your project experiences a ton of growth. Our expert facilitators and evidence-based, time-tested curriculum will guide you -- and your project! -- through enormous growth.\n\nWherever you're at, we'll help you take your research to the next level.\n\n::: {.quarto-listing .quarto-listing-container-grid}\n::: {.list .grid .quarto-listing-cols-3}\n::: {.g-col-1 .card}\n::: {.card-body .text-center style=\"color:var(--bs-body-color)\"}\n![](images/sayrelab.png){fig-alt=\"Research Handbook\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n#### [Research Handbook](https://handbook.zaposa.com){.quarto-grid-link .card-title}\n\n[A friendly, PEER-centered book on how to do research, especially in academia and especially in STEM education.](https://handbook.zaposa.com){.quarto-grid-link}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-1 .card}\n::: {.card-body .text-center style=\"color:var(--bs-body-color)\"}\n![](images/peer.png){fig-alt=\"Eleanor Sayre\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n#### [PEER model](model/index.qmd){.quarto-grid-link .card-title}\n\n[PEER is collaborative, communicative, responsive, and playful.](model/index.qmd){.quarto-grid-link}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-1 .card}\n::: {.card-body .text-center style=\"color:var(--bs-body-color)\"}\n![](images/table.png){fig-alt=\"Eleanor Sayre\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n#### [Field Schools](schools/index.qmd){.quarto-grid-link .card-title}\n\n[PEER events: upcoming, current, and past](schools/index.qmd){.quarto-grid-link}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Opportunities to participate in PEER!\n\nWhether you're just getting started, looking to stretch into new projects or methodologies, or seeking community and support around education research, we're happy to have you.
