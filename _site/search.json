    "text": "Field School Learning Outcomes\n\n\n\nParticipants in this school will…\n\n\n\n…develop and practice fundamental underlying skills and competencies in doing research, including “yes, and”, generative writing, collaboration skills, and other topics as related to specific workshops.\n…develop and make significant progress in planning their own research projects.\n…increase their self-efficacy in doing education research (and communicating research in English, as appropriate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField School Structure and Coverage\nA typical PEER field school takes participants through a development arc. We start with developing research questions and workshop norms and progress through modules on research process and research ethics. By midweek, participants have done substantial writing and development on their own projects, and we delve into methodological issues of collecting, reducing, and analyzing data from the perspective of noticing ideas (e.g. in classroom video, student free responses, or interviews) and regularizing them (e.g. through generative coding). Near the end of the field school, we give deep collaborative feedback to participants through generative presentations of their own projects, and help them plan explicitly for the next six months of research and development work.\n \n\n  \n    \n      Online Kickoff\n      Day 1\n      Day 2\n      Day 3\n      Day 4\n      Day 5\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Field School Welcome\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Elevator Talks\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Research Process Models\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Noticing: Data in Observations\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Generative Presentations\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Generative Presentations\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Refining Research Interests\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Collaboration Ethics\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Theory\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Research Methods Suite\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Authorship\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          Data & Access\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Ethics of Human Research\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Generative Presentations\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          What Comes Next?\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n \nPEER field schools are responsive to the needs of participants. In addition to the typical coverage outlined above, we also have developed additional modules to enrich their learning and meet their professional development needs. Additional modules include:\n \n\nResearch communication: talking to skeptical colleagues about your research; making beautiful posters; conducting literature reviews and situating your work in a scholarly conversation; how, when, and where to publish your work.\nResearch methods: autoethnography; conducting interviews; analyzing classroom data; fundamentals of descriptive statistics; getting started in developing a survey; design-based research projects\nResearch collaboration: building robust collaborations; advising undergraduates in research projects\nResearch life: personal stories around becoming a researcher, balancing research and other professional activities, and balancing professional activities with parenting and being a full human.\n\nSome field schools are longer or shorter. Each field school is tuned to the needs of the participants, who also receive materials related to each module such as slides, handouts, exercises, and readings.\n\n\n\n\nI want to host a Field School.\nFabulous! Contact the directors to learn about how.\n\n\nI want to join a field school.\nExciting! Check out upcoming field schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

PEER is offering an introductory field school hosted at DePaul University, and open to emerging education researchers.\n \n\nMore Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich workshops are available?\n \nWe have workshop modules for a variety of topics such as:\n \n\nGetting started with research design: building research interests into robust research projects\nResearch life: principles for being an active, productive researcher; balancing research, teaching, and life; and our personal professional pathways\nResearch ethics: how to collaborate ethically, mentor students, author papers together, and work with human subjects/participants in research projects.\nAnalysis methods: video-based qualitative research methods, emergent coding, basic quantitative methods\nResearch communication: doing lit reviews, structuring and publishing papers, making beautiful posters, and talking about your research with skeptical audiences\nTeaching students: the challenge of listening to students, fostering inclusivity and equity in classrooms, mentoring undergraduates in research\nPublishing peer-reviewed papers in English.\n\nSee Sample Field School for an example of what a field school might look like.\n \nAdditionally, we can give colloquium-style talks to broader audiences at your institution. Want something else? Contact Eleanor Sayre for more ideas, or join the announcements list to hear about new opportunities.\n\n\nHow can I host a field school?\n \nWe love to travel! A regional field school is usually one week (sometimes shorter or longer). Regional field schools tend to have themes that are appropriate to their participants: Rukara 2018 (Rwanda) focused on preparing research for publication, while Cologne 2021 (Germany) focused on equity research and video data. Vancouver 2019 (Canada) centered around designing and planning SoTL research projects. We’ll work with you to make sure our workshops are well-tuned to the things your participants need.\n \nA reasonable number of participants is 15-30; more is possible (up to 60). You should plan that most of your participants will attend every workshop in the field school. Some workshops are ok for many more participants, depending on the size of our facilitation team. We can also give colloquia, invited talks, or public lectures for larger audiences to help make the most of our visit. If a week is more time than you’re looking for, it may be possible to run a single-day workshop and/or colloquium; conversely, we’re also happy to stay longer and help your participants develop their projects further.\n \nCosts are minimal (thanks, NSF!), but scheduling is complicated. Contact Eleanor Sayre or Scott Franklin for details."
