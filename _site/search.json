A regular introductory field school is about 20 contact hours, which we recommend to split over four calendar days plus an online kickoff.\nYou should plan that most of your participants will attend every workshop in the field school. PEER is an intensive, community-centered experience. We need everyone to be present all the time in order to best support the community.\nWe can also give colloquia, invited talks, or public lectures for larger audiences to help make the most of our visit. Some workshops are ok for many more participants, depending on the size of our facilitation team; contact us if you’d like to have bonus workshops that appeal to larger audiences.\nIf a long weekend is more time than you’re looking for, it may be possible to run a single-day workshop and/or colloquium, depending on your participants’ needs and geographic location. Conversely, we’re also happy to stay longer and help your participants develop their projects further. PEER field schools can run up to 40 contact hours over 7-8 calendar days.\nGenerally speaking, we strongly prefer in-person field schools because of the rich community building and interactive nature of our curriculum. There are limited opportunities for wholly-virtual field schools available.\nWe are committed to inclusive education research and community building. We are especially interested in working with communities that have historically been exlcuded from the education research enterprise, or communities that are trying to grow their regional capacity. Because of these commitments (and our personal love of travel!), costs for hosting PEER are minimal. However, scheduling is complicated. You should plan for about a year of lead time.

    "text": "PEER changes career trajectories.\nPEER is responsive to both participants’ needs for professional development as well as responsive to their departmental and institutional needs to improve undergraduate education. Because evidence of scholarship (e.g. papers & presentations, external funding) is currency for faculty, our communicative principle pushes us to support participants’ writing as an integral part of doing research.\nPEER participants publish dozens of peer-reviewed publications, submit multiple grant proposals, and go up for tenure (successfully!), all growing from their projects and engagement with the PEER community. As one participant said, “I learned that I can do educational research within my context as a mathematics faculty — not only that it is theoretically possible, but that a once daunting possibility now seems more than accessible to me.”\n\nIt’s about your project.\nPEER prioritizes the centrality of participants’ own projects and interests; [52, 53]. as one participant stated, “[PEER helped identify] how do you go about transforming something you might be curious about into something that’s a viable research project?” Centering participants’ own projects builds on their interests and expertise in their local contexts, increasing motivation [54] and likelihood of success [33]).\nEducation research professional practice encompasses more than simply theories and methods. Faculty must develop expertise in project design and management, mentoring, communication, and cultural knowledge about community values and practices. Robust professional development must attend to this “full stack” of activities, both individually and as an integrated whole, tying everything together to build emerging researchers’ capabilities.\n\n\nWork in community and grow your network.\nIn accordance with our collaborative principle, PEER intentionally promotes peer feedback and community building, directly promoting participants’ sense of inclusion in the DBER field and self-efficacy and identity as education researchers. Our research on PEER participants highlights the importance of supportive peers, engaged subject matter experts (facilitators), and explicit attention to individual projects and project management to increase sense of belonging and competency.\nHigh quality STEM education research is not a solo effort, and many emerging DBERs face isolation as the only STEM education researcher in their department. Successful professional development must attend to their need for collaborators and communities, with teams and collaborations nucleated and supported at regional and national scales.\nThe networking opportunities at PEER nucleate new collaborations, even years after participants join a field school. Another participant highlighted how the experience not only developed skills but also built their professional network: “This experience was incredibly valuable not only in helping me consider next steps for my research, but also connecting me to some amazing humans who are now part of my professional network.”"

    "text": "Field School Learning Outcomes\n\n\n\nParticipants in this school will…\n\n\n\n…develop and practice fundamental underlying skills and competencies in doing research, including “yes, and”, generative writing, collaboration skills, and other topics as related to specific workshops.\n…develop and make significant progress in planning their own research projects.\n…increase their self-efficacy in doing education research (and communicating research in English, as appropriate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField School Structure and Coverage\nA typical PEER field school takes participants through a development arc. We start with developing research questions and workshop norms and progress through modules on research process and research ethics. By midweek, participants have done substantial writing and development on their own projects, and we delve into methodological issues of collecting, reducing, and analyzing data from the perspective of noticing ideas (e.g. in classroom video, student free responses, or interviews) and regularizing them (e.g. through generative coding). Near the end of the field school, we give deep collaborative feedback to participants through generative presentations of their own projects, and help them plan explicitly for the next six months of research and development work.\n \n\n  \n    \n      Online Kickoff\n      Day 1\n      Day 2\n      Day 3\n      Day 4\n      Day 5\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Field School Welcome\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Elevator Talks\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Research Process Models\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Noticing: Data in Observations\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Generative Presentations\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Generative Presentations\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Refining Research Interests\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Collaboration Ethics\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Theory\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Research Methods Suite\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Authorship\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          Data & Access\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Ethics of Human Research\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Generative Presentations\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          What Comes Next?\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n \nPEER field schools are responsive to the needs of participants. In addition to the typical coverage outlined above, we also have developed additional modules to enrich their learning and meet their professional development needs. Additional modules include:\n\nResearch communication: talking to skeptical colleagues about your research; making beautiful posters; conducting literature reviews and situating your work in a scholarly conversation; how, when, and where to publish your work.\nResearch methods: autoethnography; conducting interviews; analyzing classroom data; fundamentals of descriptive statistics; getting started in developing a survey; design-based research projects\nResearch collaboration: building robust collaborations; advising undergraduates in research projects\nResearch life: personal stories around becoming a researcher, balancing research and other professional activities, and balancing professional activities with parenting and being a full human.\n\nSome field schools are longer or shorter. Each field school is tuned to the needs of the participants, who also receive materials related to each module such as slides, handouts, exercises, and readings.\n\n\n\nBring PEER to you!\n\n\n\nWould you like to host a PEER field school?\n\nHosting is a great choice if you want to grow or strengthen your local community. Regional field schools typically cover our foundational material over 4-6 days. We’ll work with you to make sure our workshops meet your needs.\n\nMore Information\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming events\n\n\n\nReady to grow your research skills?\n\nPEER offers in-person and virtual events for emerging education researchers. Just getting started in education research, or curious about what PEER is like? Join us for a 90-minute virtual gateway workshop. Ready for a longer experience?
