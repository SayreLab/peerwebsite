    "text": "Field School Learning Outcomes\n\n\n\nParticipants in this school will…\n\n\n\n…develop and practice fundamental underlying skills and competencies in doing research, including “yes, and”, generative writing, collaboration skills, and other topics as related to specific workshops.\n…develop and make significant progress in planning their own research projects.\n…increase their self-efficacy in doing education research (and communicating research in English, as appropriate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField School Structure and Coverage\nA typical PEER field school takes participants through a development arc. We start with developing research questions and workshop norms and progress through modules on research process and research ethics. By midweek, participants have done substantial writing and development on their own projects, and we delve into methodological issues of collecting, reducing, and analyzing data from the perspective of noticing ideas (e.g. in classroom video, student free responses, or interviews) and regularizing them (e.g. through generative coding). Near the end of the field school, we give deep collaborative feedback to participants through generative presentations of their own projects, and help them plan explicitly for the next six months of research and development work.\n \n\n  \n    \n      Online Kickoff\n      Day 1\n      Day 2\n      Day 3\n      Day 4\n      Day 5\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Field School Welcome\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Elevator Talks\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Research Process Models\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Noticing: Data in Observations\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Generative Presentations\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Generative Presentations\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Refining Research Interests\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Collaboration Ethics\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Theory\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Research Methods Suite\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Authorship\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          Data & Access\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Ethics of Human Research\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          Generative Presentations\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          What Comes Next?\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n \nPEER field schools are responsive to the needs of participants. In addition to the typical coverage outlined above, we also have developed additional modules to enrich their learning and meet their professional development needs. Additional modules include:\n \n\nResearch communication: talking to skeptical colleagues about your research; making beautiful posters; conducting literature reviews and situating your work in a scholarly conversation; how, when, and where to publish your work.\nResearch methods: autoethnography; conducting interviews; analyzing classroom data; fundamentals of descriptive statistics; getting started in developing a survey; design-based research projects\nResearch collaboration: building robust collaborations; advising undergraduates in research projects\nResearch life: personal stories around becoming a researcher, balancing research and other professional activities, and balancing professional activities with parenting and being a full human.\n\nSome field schools are longer or shorter. Each field school is tuned to the needs of the participants, who also receive materials related to each module such as slides, handouts, exercises, and readings.\n\n\n\n\nI want to host a Field School.\nFabulous!

    "text": "PEER is designed for emerging education researchers interested in expanding their theoretical or methodological expertise. Through peer and near-peer exchange, PEER helps faculty, postdocs and graduate students through field schools, intensive workshops, research projects, mentoring, and community involvement. Many continue on after taking the program, doing research in working groups, submitting papers for peer reviewed publication or designing research projects with others. PEER focuses on Discipline-based Education Research, advancing both scholarship and teaching goals that are valued at all types of academic institutions.\n\nWho Benefits From the PEER Program?\nPEER participants come from a wide range of science backgrounds and professions. Participants include:\n\ndiscipline-based education researchers looking to expand their methodological repertoire\ndisciplinary faculty just getting started on the scholarship of teaching and learning\neducation faculty looking to join a research group and access video-based data\nfaculty development experts learning to mentor faculty through scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) projects\ngrad students and postdocs who need mentoring and community support for their research projects\nundergraduate students who attend field schools with their advisors\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
