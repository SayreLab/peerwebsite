You can help people around you do more education research, and do it better. From kick-starting your local DBER group to energizing a SoTL community, hosting a PEER field school is a great way to build capacity for education research while you elevate your personal and institutional visibility.\nLocal hosts …\n\nLead the logistics of bringing PEER to their community (funding, scheduling, securing supplies, organizing food, etc.)\nIdentify the primary audience for their field school (grad students, postdocs, faculty, disciplines, local or regional partners)\nWork closely with PEER facilitators to develop goals for the field school and set a curriculum that serves their participants’ needs.\nBuild community between and after sessions through meals and social activities\nDo local recruitment and advertising for the field school, and coordinate with PEER facilitators on other advertising\nAssist in the application and registration process\n\nWe’ll work with you every step of the way so that your field school is successful.\n\nRegional Field School Hosting\nAre you a part of a regional consortium of Centers for Teaching and Learning or Education Research? We can do regional field schools too! A regional field school brings together people near you to build capacity and community. It’s a great way to support (or jump-start!) regional collaborations.

A regular introductory field school is about 20 contact hours, which we recommend to split over four calendar days plus an online kickoff.\nYou should plan that most of your participants will attend every workshop in the field school. PEER is an intensive, community-centered experience. We need everyone to be present all the time in order to best support the community.\nWe can also give colloquia, invited talks, or public lectures for larger audiences to help make the most of our visit. Some workshops are ok for many more participants, depending on the size of our facilitation team; contact us if you’d like to have bonus workshops that appeal to larger audiences.\nIf a long weekend is more time than you’re looking for, it may be possible to run a single-day workshop and/or colloquium, depending on your participants’ needs and geographic location. Conversely, we’re also happy to stay longer and help your participants develop their projects further. PEER field schools can run up to 40 contact hours over 7-8 calendar days.\nGenerally speaking, we strongly prefer in-person field schools because of the rich community building and interactive nature of our curriculum. There are limited opportunities for wholly-virtual field schools available.\nWe are committed to inclusive education research and community building. We are especially interested in working with communities that have historically been exlcuded from the education research enterprise, or communities that are trying to grow their regional capacity. Because of these commitments (and our personal love of travel!), costs for hosting PEER are minimal. However, scheduling is complicated. You should plan for about a year of lead time. Contact Eleanor Sayre or Scott Franklin for details."

    "text": "PEER changes career trajectories.\nPEER is responsive to both participants’ needs for professional development as well as responsive to their departmental and institutional needs to improve undergraduate education. Because evidence of scholarship (e.g. papers & presentations, external funding) is currency for faculty, our communicative principle pushes us to support participants’ writing as an integral part of doing research.\nPEER participants publish dozens of peer-reviewed publications, submit multiple grant proposals, and go up for tenure (successfully!), all growing from their projects and engagement with the PEER community. As one participant said, “I learned that I can do educational research within my context as a mathematics faculty — not only that it is theoretically possible, but that a once daunting possibility now seems more than accessible to me.”\n\n\nIt’s about your project.\nPEER prioritizes the centrality of participants’ own projects and interests; [52, 53]. as one participant stated, “[PEER helped identify] how do you go about transforming something you might be curious about into something that’s a viable research project?” Centering participants’ own projects builds on their interests and expertise in their local contexts, increasing motivation [54] and likelihood of success [33].\nEducation research professional practice encompasses more than simply theories and methods. Faculty must develop expertise in project design and management, mentoring, communication, and cultural knowledge about community values and practices. Robust professional development must attend to this “full stack” of activities, both individually and as an integrated whole, tying everything together to build emerging researchers’ capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n“PEER was really impactful for me and gave me a kick start to begin the process which seemed overwhelming. It gave me confidence and experience thinking about educational research. I came up with an entirely new project and ran with it. I was able to come up with a better research question, get IRB approval, and draft a conference paper (submitted last week!).”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“My community has grown BY A LOT since being at PEER. There are so many helpful people within my discipline and outside!”\n\n\n\n\nWork in community and grow your network.\nIn accordance with our collaborative principle, PEER intentionally promotes peer feedback and community building, directly promoting participants’ sense of inclusion in the DBER field and self-efficacy and identity as education researchers. Our research on PEER participants highlights the importance of supportive peers, engaged subject matter experts (facilitators), and explicit attention to individual projects and project management to increase sense of belonging and competency.\nHigh quality STEM education research is not a solo effort, and many emerging DBERs face isolation as the only STEM education researcher in their department. Successful professional development must attend to their need for collaborators and communities, with teams and collaborations nucleated and supported at regional and national scales.\nThe networking opportunities at PEER nucleate new collaborations, even years after participants join a field school. Another participant highlighted how the experience not only developed skills but also built their professional network: “This experience was incredibly valuable not only in helping me consider next steps for my research, but also connecting me to some amazing humans who are now part of my professional network.”"

Analysis?\nAre you looking for ideas on related research?\nDo you need ideas to narrow or broaden the scope of your work?\nAre you trying to identify a hook for your research?\n\nProvide just enough information to orient the audience to your project so that they can provide the feedback you are seeking\nDon’t worry about not giving enough information.

Being explicit about the kinds of feedback you’re looking for helps the audience focus their attention and conversation to the things that will be most helpful in moving you forward.\nThere are many possible forms of feedback you could want. Some common ones are:\n\nIs this feasible in the time I have or with the resources I have?\nWhat literature (or keywords) should I be looking at for related work?\nAre there any elements of my project which seem superfluous or extra?\nCan you help me align my research interests with my research design better?\n\n\n\nElevator Pitch: Orient us to your project\nYou will have 5 minutes to share about the kinds of feedback you are looking for and to orient the audience to your project. This means there 1-2 minutes of this will be spent outlining the feedback you are seeking and the rest will be about your project. Your elevator pitch shouldn’t take more than 2-3 minutes and you should strive for a 2-slide limit to support the pitch. It’s a good practice to end with a reminder of the feedback you are looking for.\nDon’t feel the need to include every detail about your project, just share the most important ones to orient the audience. Think of this elevator pitch as a conversation starter. The audience will ask questions to get the information they need to provide you feedback. Keep your responses to questions as concise as possible and provide only the information they asked for.\nInclude contact information (name, institution, email address) at the end of your GP so that anyone who did not get to share their thoughts with you can contact you later.\n\n\n\nScribes: record what we say so that the presenter can focus on the moment.\nDuring the presentation, the scribe takes notes on what the group talks about so that the audience and presenter can focus on thinking and communicating. After the GP, the notes will be shared with the presenter so they can move forward with the awesome ideas the group generated.\nTaking notes can make it difficult to speak during discussion, so if you’re feeling a little quiet this role can allow you to still contribute to the GP process. Notably, women are disproportionately asked to take notes, even though they do not enjoy it more than men do. If you identify as a man, this is a great opportunity to practice allyship while building your note-taking skills and contributing to a space that breaks down traditional gender roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate for notes\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be helpful to structure your notes as follows:\nHeader:  [Put the name of the presenter, your name, and your email here]\nAudience Idea: [Put idea posed by an audience member here]\n\nTrack the follow-up discussion resulting from the idea here\nand here\nand here\n\nAudience Question: [Put a question posed by an audience member here]\n\nTrack the follow-up discussion resulting from this question here\nand here\nand here\n\nPresenter Question: [Put a question posed by the presenter here]\n\nTrack the follow-up discussion resulting from this question here\nand here\nand here"

The facilitator will keep track of the timing and signal when it is time to move on from elevator pitch to clarifying questions to “yes, and”. Audience members will drive the “yes, and” conversation. The scribe will take notes on the conversation that flows from the presentation.\nThe generative feedback about the project is immensely valuable to the presenter. Participating in these discussions also helps audience members recognize their own expertise, see the expertise of their peers, and grow their expertise.\nAs a member of the audience, please resist the temptation to dominate the conversation with lots of followup questions and detailed suggestions; rather try to offer concise suggestions and make space for others to offer their ideas. If you have lots of additional ideas you want to share with the speaker, make a note to connect with them after the presentation.\nAudience members are strongly encouraged to have more discussions with the presenter about their project. Use this as an opportunity to build community!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPs are awesome: PEER participant reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I liked how the generative presentations created community.”\n\n\n“[I was excited about] doing the generative presentation to get specific feedback on the part that has stumped me the most with a project.”\n\n\n“I got valuable feedback on my project. It has motivated me to pursue if more seriously.”\n\n\n“I liked how the generative presentations created community.”\n\n\n“I really liked how the generative presentations allowed the whole group to participate.”"

There is uber/lyft available as well as taxis. If you are bringing or renting a car, you should coordinate with Matt Sayre before you arrive to arrange for a parking pass to the RIT campus. You can tell your phone to direct you to “405 Global Way”; don’t just drive/uber/lyft to “RIT” because that will take you to the wrong part of campus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn-campus housing\n\n\n\n\n\nRIT housing will be in Global Village, dorm E (also known as Global Village 405). (campus map). These are suites of single rooms with shared bathrooms, living areas, and micro-kitchens in each suite. Each room comes with a packet of bedding & towel. You should bring your own toiletries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParking\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you park on campus, you should park in “General parking” (NOT RESERVED PARKING). The Global village Lot is directly behind the dorms; Lot S is close to Global Village and Gosnell Hall where we will be meeting; Lot F is also close to Gosnell. Campus map: GOS/008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession locations & campus map\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific session rooms: TBD. Campus map: GOS/008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast and lunch is provided every day of the field school. Breakfast is typically fruit, granola, yogurt, and pastries; coffee and tea are available. The joint grocery list is in the participant materials. Lunch is available via RIT dining card; there are a number of different fast-casual options near Global Village.\nThere is an optional pre-dinner at Dogtown on Wednesday at 6:30pm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWifi access\n\n\n\n\n\nRIT has both eduroam (if your institution participates) and a guest network. Select “RIT guest” and follow the prompts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel panic\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are experiencing travel panic on the day of travel, you can text Matt Sayre (785-313-5038) or Eleanor Sayre (785-313-5039)."
