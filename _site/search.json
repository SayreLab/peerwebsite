There is uber/lyft available as well as taxis. If you are bringing or renting a car, you should coordinate with Matt Sayre before you arrive to arrange for a parking pass to the RIT campus. You can tell your phone to direct you to “405 Global Way”; don’t just drive/uber/lyft to “RIT” because that will take you to the wrong part of campus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn-campus housing\n\n\n\n\n\nRIT housing will be in Global Village, dorm E (also known as Global Village 405).

You should bring your own toiletries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParking\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you park on campus, you should park in “General parking” (NOT RESERVED PARKING).

Breakfast is typically fruit, granola, yogurt, and pastries; coffee and tea are available. The joint grocery list is in the participant materials. Lunch is available via RIT dining card; there are a number of different fast-casual options near Global Village.\nThere is an optional pre-dinner at Dogtown on Wednesday at 6:30pm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWifi access\n\n\n\n\n\nRIT has both eduroam (if your institution participates) and a guest network. Select “RIT guest” and follow the prompts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel panic\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are experiencing travel panic on the day of travel, you can text Matt Sayre (785-313-5038) or Eleanor Sayre (785-313-5039)."

You can help people around you do more education research, and do it better.

We can do regional field schools too! A regional field school brings together people near you to build capacity and community. It’s a great way to support (or jump-start!) regional collaborations. If you’re at a smaller school, consider inviting your friends and colleagues at nearby institutions so that everyone can grow together.\nWe’ll work with you to make sure our workshops are well-tuned to the things your participants need."

A regular introductory field school is about 20 contact hours, which we recommend to split over four calendar days plus an online kickoff.\nYou should plan that most of your participants will attend every workshop in the field school. PEER is an intensive, community-centered experience. We need everyone to be present all the time in order to best support the community.\nWe can also give colloquia, invited talks, or public lectures for larger audiences to help make the most of our visit. Some workshops are ok for many more participants, depending on the size of our facilitation team; contact us if you’d like to have bonus workshops that appeal to larger audiences.\nIf a long weekend is more time than you’re looking for, it may be possible to run a single-day workshop and/or colloquium, depending on your participants’ needs and geographic location. Conversely, we’re also happy to stay longer and help your participants develop their projects further. PEER field schools can run up to 40 contact hours over 7-8 calendar days.\nGenerally speaking, we strongly prefer in-person field schools because of the rich community building and interactive nature of our curriculum. There are limited opportunities for wholly-virtual field schools available.\nWe are committed to inclusive education research and community building. We are especially interested in working with communities that have historically been exlcuded from the education research enterprise, or communities that are trying to grow their regional capacity. Because of these commitments (and our personal love of travel!), costs for hosting PEER are minimal. However, scheduling is complicated. You should plan for about a year of lead time.

    "text": "PEER changes career trajectories.\nPEER is responsive to both participants’ needs for professional development as well as responsive to their departmental and institutional needs to improve undergraduate education. Because evidence of scholarship (e.g. papers & presentations, external funding) is currency for faculty, our communicative principle pushes us to support participants’ writing as an integral part of doing research.\nPEER participants publish dozens of peer-reviewed publications, submit multiple grant proposals, and go up for tenure (successfully!), all growing from their projects and engagement with the PEER community. As one participant said, “I learned that I can do educational research within my context as a mathematics faculty — not only that it is theoretically possible, but that a once daunting possibility now seems more than accessible to me.”\n\nIt’s about your project.\nPEER prioritizes the centrality of participants’ own projects and interests; [52, 53]. as one participant stated, “[PEER helped identify] how do you go about transforming something you might be curious about into something that’s a viable research project?” Centering participants’ own projects builds on their interests and expertise in their local contexts, increasing motivation [54] and likelihood of success [33].\nEducation research professional practice encompasses more than simply theories and methods. Faculty must develop expertise in project design and management, mentoring, communication, and cultural knowledge about community values and practices. Robust professional development must attend to this “full stack” of activities, both individually and as an integrated whole, tying everything together to build emerging researchers’ capabilities.\n\n\nWork in community and grow your network.\nIn accordance with our collaborative principle, PEER intentionally promotes peer feedback and community building, directly promoting participants’ sense of inclusion in the DBER field and self-efficacy and identity as education researchers. Our research on PEER participants highlights the importance of supportive peers, engaged subject matter experts (facilitators), and explicit attention to individual projects and project management to increase sense of belonging and competency.\nHigh quality STEM education research is not a solo effort, and many emerging DBERs face isolation as the only STEM education researcher in their department. Successful professional development must attend to their need for collaborators and communities, with teams and collaborations nucleated and supported at regional and national scales.\nThe networking opportunities at PEER nucleate new collaborations, even years after participants join a field school. Another participant highlighted how the experience not only developed skills but also built their professional network: “This experience was incredibly valuable not only in helping me consider next steps for my research, but also connecting me to some amazing humans who are now part of my professional network.”"

    "text": "What does PEER look like?\nIn a PEER field school, you’ll work in a supportive community to build your skills and your research project along several overlapping development arcs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamental Skills\n\nGenerative writing, having a growth mindset, playing “yes, and”, mentoring students, researching as a parallel process, and iterating\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Design\n\nRefining research questions, choosing theoretical frameworks, matching data streams to research questions and analysis methods, planning research projects, and building resilient and flexible projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Communication\n\nEncapsulating your project, developing an elevator pitch, reading research literature, publishing peer-reviewed papers, negotiating authorship, finding collaborators, and giving robust constructive feedback on each other’s projects.\n\n\nDoes this sound like a lot? It is. PEER field schools are intense, experiential, and supportive. You don’t just learn these things abstractly; you actively practice them with your project. You are ready for PEER when you are enthusiastic about stretching your skills, refining your project, and getting energized about doing research.\n\n\n\nJoin the list!\n\n\n\nCurious about other possibilities?\n\nDon’t miss out on PEER events.\nJoin our announcements list to hear about upcoming field schools, virtual gateways, and other PEER events.\n\n\n\nJoin the list!\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming events\n\n\n\nReady to grow your research skills?\n\nPEER offers in-person and virtual events for emerging education researchers. Just getting started in education research, or curious about what PEER is like? Join us for a 90-minute virtual gateway workshop. Ready for a longer experience? Apply for an upcoming field school.\n\n\n\nUpcoming events"
