  <!-- Dynamically set the school name variable -->
  <script>
    // Define the school name variable
    // THIS MUST BE THE SAME AS THE GOOGLE SHEETS PAGE NAME
    var schoolName = "Boston 2024"; // Change this to the desired school name

    // Encode the school name to make it URL-safe
    var encodedSchoolName = encodeURIComponent(schoolName);

To build a supportive community, participants must actively engage during all sessions in the field school.  Partial attendance is not permitted.

# Who Should Attend?
 
PEER targets a broad diversity of experience and interest in discipline-based education research (DBER). The workshop is appropriate for:

* Faculty not currently engaged in DBER but interested in learning about theories and methodologies for possible future research
* Current DBER researchers looking to build or broaden their network of collaborators and engage in generative discussions about existing and new projects
* Graduate students or postdoctoral researchers who want to learn more about DBER project management and building a successful research program
* Faculty at teaching-focused universities interested in using research methodology to improve or assess their teaching and/or publish in Scholarship of Teaching & Learning

This field school is centered on building regional capacity and community.  We welcome applicants who work at Harvard or MIT, or by special invitation from the local hosts. 


# What do we do?

### PEER builds core competencies in education research
