# Upcoming Field schools

Upcoming regional schools will be held in the US as well as internationally (as travel permits). Entrance requirements for regional schools vary; contact [Eleanor Sayre](https://zaposa.com/contact-me) or join the [announcements list](contact.qmd) for details.

Note: Since the syllabus for each field school is adapted to the needs of the participants, the syllabi for a given field school are only available to registered participants. However, a sample syllabus is available on the [Sample Field School](../workshops.qmd) page.
