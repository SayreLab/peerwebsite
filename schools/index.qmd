## PEER Field Schools

In a PEER Field school, you will work intensively on your research project with your co-participants and our expert facilitators. The PEER curriculum covers fundamental skills like generative writing and collaborative feedback as well as foundational topics like choosing theoretical frameworks and matching research questions with data streams.  

Field schools are offered in-person only. Whether they're a regional group of researchers in your area, or a national community of education researchers, your PEER co-participants will support you as you learn together. Each Field School serves a slightly different population, and we tune the curriculum to match your needs. 

Wherever you're at, we'll help you take your research to the next level.
