# Who Should Attend?
 
PEER targets a broad diversity of experience and interest in discipline-based education research (DBER). The workshop is appropriate for:

* Faculty not currently engaged in DBER but interested in learning about theories and methodologies for possible future research
* Current DBER researchers looking to build or broaden their network of collaborators and engage in generative discussions about existing and new projects
* Graduate students or postdoctoral researchers who want to learn more about DBER project management and building a successful research program
* Faculty at teaching-focused universities interested in using research methodology to improve or assess their teaching and/or publish in Scholarship of Teaching & Learning

This field school is centered on building regional capacity and community.  We welcome all applicants who work or reside within a three-hour radius of State College; applicants outside of this radius should make a strong case for their current or future ties to the DBER community in this geographic area.
