In this interactive, online workshop, we’ll introduce you to fundamental skills in education research. You’ll practice these skills with each other to develop your research ideas and conceptualize a research project.


&nbsp;  


# What do we cover?

&nbsp;  

* Refining your research interests into answerable research questions.
* Generative writing: how research gets done and papers get written.
* Playing “yes, and” to find collaborators and improve your projects.


&nbsp;  


# Who should attend?

&nbsp;  

PEER targets a broad diversity of experience and interest in discipline-based education research (DBER) and the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL). The workshop is appropriate for:

* Faculty not currently engaged in DBER but interested in learning about theories and methodologies for possible future research.
* Current DBER researchers looking to build or broaden their network of collaborators and engage in generative discussions about existing and new projects.
* Graduate students or postdoctoral researchers who want to learn more about DBER project management and building a successful research program
* Faculty at teaching-focused universities interested in using research methodology to improve or assess their teaching and/or publish in Scholarship of Teaching & Learning


&nbsp; 


# How much does it cost?

&nbsp; 

This virtual workshop is free to attend, but space is limited and a recording will not be made available.


&nbsp; 


# How should I prepare?

&nbsp; 

* Register in advance.
* Read about [writing as a generative process](https://handbook.zaposa.com/articles/generative-writing/), and prepare to engage in your own writing during the workshop. During the workshop, you’ll do generative writing around your research interests and questions.
* Make sure your zoom software is up-to-date and test your microphone and camera. During the workshop, you’ll work in a collaborative breakout group with other participants.
* Look for a calendar invite with a zoom link.
