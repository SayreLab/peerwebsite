PEER enhances the professional growth of participants and changes career trajectories.  In this interactive, online workshop, we’ll introduce you to fundamental skills in education research. You’ll practice these skills with each other to develop your research ideas and conceptualize a research project.

No matter where you are in your education research journey, we'll take you to the next step.

## What do we cover?


* Refining your research interests into answerable research questions.
* Generative writing: how research gets done and papers get written.
* Playing “yes, and” to find collaborators and improve your projects.


## Who should attend?

PEER targets a broad diversity of experience and interest in discipline-based education research (DBER) and the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL). The workshop is appropriate for:

* Faculty not currently engaged in DBER but interested in learning about theories and methodologies for possible future research.
* Current DBER researchers looking to build or broaden their network of collaborators and engage in generative discussions about existing and new projects.
* Graduate students or postdoctoral researchers who want to learn more about DBER project management and building a successful research program
* Faculty at teaching-focused universities interested in using research methodology to improve or assess their teaching and/or publish in Scholarship of Teaching & Learning


## How much does it cost?

This virtual workshop is free to attend, but space is limited and a recording will not be made available.


## How should I prepare?

* [Register](registration.qmd) in advance.
* Read about [writing as a generative process](https://handbook.zaposa.com/articles/generative-writing/), and prepare to engage in your own writing during the workshop. During the workshop, you’ll do generative writing around your research interests and questions.
* Make sure your zoom software is up-to-date and test your microphone and camera. During the workshop, you’ll work in a collaborative breakout group with other participants.
* Look for a calendar invite with a zoom link.
