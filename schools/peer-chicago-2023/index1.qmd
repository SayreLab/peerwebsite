This 4-day, intensive, in-person PEER workshop gives opportunities for faculty, postdocs, and graduate students in various disciplines to develop their own educational research practices. PEER supports emerging education researchers in developing their research interests into concrete questions, developing short- and long-term research plans, building community with other education researchers, and making progress on advancing projects to publication.

PEER targets a broad diversity of experience and interest in discipline-based education research (DBER). The workshop is appropriate for:

* Faculty not currently engaged in DBER but interested in learning about theories and methodologies for possible future research
* Current DBER researchers looking to build or broaden their network of collaborators and engage in generative discussions about existing and new projects
* Graduate students or postdoctoral researchers who want to learn more about DBER project management and building a successful research program
* Faculty at teaching-focused universities interested in using research methodology to improve or assess their teaching and/or publish in Scholarship of Teaching & Learning
