Syntax:
brew syntax is quite simple and there are very few delimiters to learn:

1. All text that falls outside of the delimiters is printed as-is.

2. R expressions between the '<%' and '%>' delimiters are executed in-place.

3. The value of the R expression between the '<%=' and '%>' delimiters is printed.

4. All text between the '<%#' and '%>' delimiters is thrown away. Use it as a comment.

5. If you place a '-' just before the '%>' delimiter, and it's placed at the end of a line, then the newline is omitted from the output.
