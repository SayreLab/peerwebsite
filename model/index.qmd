## Who Benefits From the PEER program?

PEER participants come from a wide range of science backgrounds and professions. Participants include:  

* Discipline-based education researchers looking to expand their methodological repertoire
* Disciplinary faculty just getting started on the scholarship of teaching and learning
* Education faculty looking to join a research group and access video-based data
* Faculty development experts learning to mentor faculty through scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) projects 
* Graduate students and postdoctorates who need mentoring and community support for their research projects
* Undergraduate students who attend field schools with their advisors

Our collaborators and hosts at the University of Cologne made a promotional video for their [PEER field school](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fzus.uni-koeln.de%2Fpeer.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHnBsqbSNnmTPRlNQj3fVI_7jqRFQ).

## What does PEER look like?

In a PEER field school, you'll work in a supportive community to build your skills and your research project along several overlapping development arcs:

Does this sound like a lot?  It is.  PEER field schools are intense, experiential, and supportive. You don't just learn these things abstractly; you actively practice them with your project. You are ready for PEER when you are enthusiastic about stretching your skills, refining your project, and getting energized about doing research.
