## Who Benefits From the PEER program?

PEER participants come from a wide range of science backgrounds and professions. Participants include:  

* Discipline-based education researchers looking to expand their methodological repertoire
* Disciplinary faculty just getting started on the scholarship of teaching and learning
* Education faculty looking to join a research group and access video-based data
* Faculty development experts learning to mentor faculty through scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) projects 
* Graduate students and postdoctorates who need mentoring and community support for their research projects
* Undergraduate students who attend field schools with their advisors

## What does PEER look like?

In a PEER field school, you'll work in a supportive community to build your skills and your research project along several overlapping development arcs:

**Fundamental Skills**
:::
Generative writing, having a growth mindset, playing “yes, and”, mentoring students, researching as a parallel process, and iterating

:::{.bi .bi-columns-gap style="font-size: 70px"}

:::
::: {style="font-size: 135%;"}
**Research Design**
:::
Refining research questions, choosing theoretical frameworks, matching data streams to research questions and analysis methods, planning research projects, and building resilient and flexible projects.
:::

:::{.bi .bi-easel style="font-size: 70px"}

:::
::: {style="font-size: 135%;"}
**Research Communication**
:::
Encapsulating your project, developing an elevator pitch, reading research literature, publishing peer-reviewed papers, negotiating authorship, finding collaborators, and giving robust constructive feedback on each other’s projects.

## Does PEER sound like a lot?

It is.  PEER field schools are intense, experiential, and supportive. You don't just learn these things abstractly; you actively practice them with your project. You are ready for PEER when you are enthusiastic about stretching your skills, refining your project, and getting energized about doing research.
