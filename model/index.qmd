## Welcome to PEER!

At PEER Field Schools, you'll delve into research project development and best practices, engage with like-minded professionals, and gain invaluable insights into the world of educational research. Our expert facilitators will guide you through hands-on activities and collaborative discussions, helping you shape your project and engage your passion. 

PEER will boost your education research skills and push your project forward!


## PEER Principles

At PEER, we believe research is 

* Responsive: Field schools respond to participant needs
* Playful: Researchers play with ideas and data to generate new knowledge
* Communicative: Writing and presenting are part of research
* Collaborative: People do research together, in communities.

At PEER, you will learn fundamental and applied research skills in a supportive and participatory research environment. 

## Who Benefits From the PEER program?

PEER participants come from a wide range of science backgrounds and professions. Participants include:  

* Discipline-based education researchers looking to expand their methodological repertoire
* Disciplinary faculty just getting started on the scholarship of teaching and learning
* education faculty looking to join a research group and access video-based data
* Faculty development experts learning to mentor faculty through scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) projects 
* Graduate students and postdoctorates who need mentoring and community support for their research projects
* undergraduate students who attend field schools with their advisors

Our collaborators and hosts at the University of Cologne made a promotional video for their [PEER field school](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fzus.uni-koeln.de%2Fpeer.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHnBsqbSNnmTPRlNQj3fVI_7jqRFQ).

## What does PEER look like?

In a PEER field school, you'll work in a supportive community to build your skills and your research project along several overlapping development arcs:

* Fundamental skills: generative writing, growth mindset, "yes, and", mentoring students, parallel processes and iteration.
* Research design: refining research questions, choosing theoretical frameworks, matching data streams to research questions and analysis methods, planning research projects, and building resilient and flexible projects.  
* Research communication: encapsulating your project, developing an elevator pitch, reading research literature, publishing peer-reviewed papers, negotiating authorship, finding collaborators, and giving robust constructive feedback on each other's projects.

Does this sound like a lot?  It is.  PEER field schools are intense, experiential, and supportive. You don't just learn these things abstractly; you actively practice them with your project. You are ready for PEER when you are enthusiastic about stretching your skills, refining your project, and getting energized about doing research.
