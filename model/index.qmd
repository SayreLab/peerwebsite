## What is PEER?

At PEER Field Schools, you'll delve into research project development and best practices, engage with like-minded professionals, and gain invaluable insights into the world of educational research. Our expert facilitators will guide you through hands-on activities and collaborative discussions, helping you shape your project and engage your passion. 

PEER will boost your education research skills and push your project forward!


## PEER Principles

At PEER, you will learn fundamental and applied research skills in a supportive and participatory research environment. We believe research is:

## Who Benefits From the PEER program?

PEER participants come from a wide range of science backgrounds and professions. Participants include:  

* Discipline-based education researchers looking to expand their methodological repertoire
* Disciplinary faculty just getting started on the scholarship of teaching and learning
* Education faculty looking to join a research group and access video-based data
* Faculty development experts learning to mentor faculty through scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) projects 
* Graduate students and postdoctorates who need mentoring and community support for their research projects
* Undergraduate students who attend field schools with their advisors

Our collaborators and hosts at the University of Cologne made a promotional video for their [PEER field school](/schools/2024-koln).

## What does PEER look like?

In a PEER field school, you'll work in a supportive community to build your skills and your research project along several overlapping development arcs:

::: {.quarto-listing .quarto-listing-container-grid .list .grid .quarto-listing-cols-3 .bg-info}

:::{.g-col-1 .card .card-body .text-center .bg-info .border-info}

:::{.bi .bi-ladder  style="font-size: 70px"}

:::
::: {style="font-size: 135%;"}
**Fundamental Skills**
:::
Generative writing, having a growth mindset, playing “yes, and”, mentoring students, researching as a parallel process, and iterating
:::

:::{.bi .bi-columns-gap style="font-size: 70px"}

:::
::: {style="font-size: 135%;"}
**Research Design**
:::
Refining research questions, choosing theoretical frameworks, matching data streams to research questions and analysis methods, planning research projects, and building resilient and flexible projects.

:::{.bi .bi-easel style="font-size: 70px"}

:::
::: {style="font-size: 135%;"}
**Research Communication**
:::
Encapsulating your project, developing an elevator pitch, reading research literature, publishing peer-reviewed papers, negotiating authorship, finding collaborators, and giving robust constructive feedback on each other’s projects.

Does this sound like a lot?  It is.  PEER field schools are intense, experiential, and supportive. You don't just learn these things abstractly; you actively practice them with your project. You are ready for PEER when you are enthusiastic about stretching your skills, refining your project, and getting energized about doing research.
