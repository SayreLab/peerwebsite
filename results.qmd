PEER participants walk away with the tools to push forward on their education research goals and a community to support them. Whether someone is participating in PEER for the first time or returning for the second (or nth) time, participants have a positive experience.

If you are interested in conducting research and donâ€™t know where begin or feel overwhelmed, the PEER field school is perfect to give you the boost you need to help you continue heading in the right direction.

I am excited about doing research again. I feel like this program has reminded my reasons for why I want to do research.

It was affirming to hear that my work is interesting and also great feedback on where to refine and define pieces. It was great to have time to think deeply on my project and its process.
